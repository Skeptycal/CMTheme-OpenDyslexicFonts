Typeface/font to help readability, and help readability for some of the
symptoms of dyslexia.

Your brain can sometimes do funny things to letters. OpenDyslexic tries to help
prevent some of these things from happening. Letters have heavy weighted
bottoms to provide an indication of orientation to make it more difficult to
confuse with other similar letters. Consistently weighted bottoms can also help
reenforce the line of text. The unique shapes of each letter can help prevent
flipping and swapping.

The italic style for OpenDyslexic has been crafted still be able to be used for
emphasis while still being readable.
